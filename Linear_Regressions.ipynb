        "\n",
        "Linear regression is one of the simplest and most fundamental algorithms in supervised learning. It's used to predict a continuous target variable based on one or more input features.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 1. Basic Concept\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the input features (independent variables, \\(X\\)) and the target variable (dependent variable, \\(Y\\)):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 X_1 + \\beta_2 X_2 + \\ldots + \\beta_n X_n + \\epsilon \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- \\( Y \\) is the predicted value.\n",
        "- \\( X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n \\) are the input features.\n",
        "- \\( \\beta_0 \\) is the intercept.\n",
        "- \\( \\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_n \\) are the coefficients.\n",
        "- \\( \\epsilon \\) is the error term.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Assumptions of Linear Regression\n",
        "- **Linearity**: The relationship between the independent and dependent variables should be linear.\n",
        "- **Independence**: Observations should be independent of each other.\n",
        "- **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of the errors.\n",
        "- **Normality**: For inference, the errors should be normally distributed.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS)\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common method to estimate the coefficients in linear regression is the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, which minimizes the sum of squared residuals (the difference between the observed and predicted values):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[ \\text{Cost Function} = \\sum_{i=1}^{m} (Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2 \\]\n",
        "\n",
        "where:\n",
        "- \\( Y_i \\) is the actual value.\n",
        "- \\( \\hat{Y_i} \\) is the predicted value.\n",

        "#### 6. Regularization\n",
